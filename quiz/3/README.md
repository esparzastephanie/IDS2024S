1. i. natural phenomena (we notice natural occurences)  
   ii. observe data (we note the relevant observable data)  
   iii. contruct models for analyzing and then calibrate/validate the data  
   iv. make a prediction
2. experiment, theory, computation+data
3. predictive computing (predict what cells are alive after a stroke) , numerical simulation (adaptive stochastic sampling methods), d ata driven discovery (detecting traffic on a road)
4. deductive reasoning: ex. If you are breathing, you are alive.  
   plausible reasoning: ex. If it is going to rain, the sky will become cloudy right before that.  -OR- If the sky is cloudy, it will rain.
5. They are not the same because a logical consequence is merely a logical consequence, which isn't guaranteed to happen. It doesn't necessarily ascertain a causal physical consequence.
