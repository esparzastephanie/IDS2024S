1. [Here is the README file I created](../../README.md)   
2. Types of VCS are: Local, Centralized, & Distributed  
3. Distributed VCS is the best one because it allows for secure repository cloning and restoration.  
4.    a.  git pull: Pulls the latest project revision from the remote to the local repository.  
    b.  git status: Check the status of a project.  
    c.  git add --all: Add multiple modified or new files to the staging area.  
    d.  git commit -m"latest build": Commit the staged file to the repository with the message "latest build".  
    e. git push --all: Push all your commits from the local repository to the remote repository.
