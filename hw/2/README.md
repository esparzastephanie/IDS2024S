   b)  FORTRAN (1954), lisp(1958),  Algol 58 (1958), basic (1964), C(1971), sh(197), C++ (1983), Java (1991), Python (1991), Fortran 90(1991), JavaScript(1995), C# (2000).

3. ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.  
4. Integers are used because all computer hardware runs on binary numbers (or bits), 0 and 1.  
5. RAM  
6. Disk  
7. bits  
8. a) fortran  
   b) Yes  
9. a) Cobol  
   b)1959  
10. a) Assembly  
   b) Fortran, C, and C++ are 3rd gen. MATLAB, Python, and R are 4th gen.\
11. C - 70s  
    C++, MATLAB - 80s  
    Python - 90s
12. An ancestor of C is B.
13. C with classes.
14. An ancestor of python is ABC, 
15. Registers
16. KB
17. 100+ times faster  
18. 1000 times faster.  
19. 1 million times faster.  
20. They control the flow of electrons, acting as either a switch or amplifier.  
21. The amount of transistors you can put in a machine is limited by the memory speed.  
22. Fetch, decode, execute.  
23. Yes, because modern cpu's with lower cores may run processes more efficiently.  
24. Memory access, because the memory can only go so fast based on the number of cores.**
25. Dennard Scaling (MOSFET Scaling) implies that the more transistors put on an IC, the faster the CPU will be. Moore's law entails Gordon Moore's prediction that transistor counts in microprocessors would double every two years.
26. a) 64 grains  
    b) 2080 grains  
    c)  0.3 pounds of rice
