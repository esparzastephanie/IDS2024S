1. a)   ![pdf of puzzle filled in](progLangChartPuzzle.pdf)   
   b)  FORTRAN (1954), lisp(1958),  Algol 58 (1958), basic (1964), C(1971), sh(197), C++ (1983), Java (1991), Python (1991), Fortran 90(1991), JavaScript(1995), C# (2000).

2. ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.  
3. Integers are used because all computer hardware runs on binary numbers (or bits), 0 and 1.  
4. RAM  
5. Disk  
6. bits  
7. a) fortran  
   b) Yes  
8. a) Cobol  
   b)1959  
9. a) Assembly  
   b) Fortran, C, and C++ are 3rd gen. MATLAB, Python, and R are 4th gen.\
10. C - 70s  
    C++, MATLAB - 80s  
    Python - 90s
11. An ancestor of C is B.
12. C with classes.
13. An ancestor of python is ABC, 
14. Registers
15. KB
16. 100+ times faster  
17. 1000 times faster.  
18. 1 million times faster.  
19. They control the flow of electrons, acting as either a switch or amplifier.  
20. The amount of transistors you can put in a machine is limited by the memory speed.  
21. Fetch, decode, execute.  
22. Yes, because modern cpu's with lower cores may run processes more efficiently.  
23. Memory access, because the memory can only go so fast based on the number of cores.**
24. Dennard Scaling (MOSFET Scaling) implies that the more transistors put on an IC, the faster the CPU will be. Moore's law entails Gordon Moore's prediction that tansistor counts in microprocessors would double every two years.
25. a) 64 grains  
    b) 2080 grains  
    c)  0.3 pounds of rice  
26. a) 2^63 grains of rice  
    b) 2^63 grains of rice 
    c) 1.32 X 10^15  
    d) ~659 years  

**Extra points:**  
1. Exponential behavior is faster growth of a changing value based on the base number. Power-Law behavior use times 10^x to describe the frequency of a value.
