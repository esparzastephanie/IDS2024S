19. They control the flow of electrons, acting as either a switch or amplifier.  
20. The amount of transistors you can put in a machine is limited by the memory speed.  
21. Fetch, decode, execute.  
22. Yes, because modern cpu's with lower cores may run processes more efficiently.  
23. Memory access, because the memory can only go so fast based on the number of cores.**
